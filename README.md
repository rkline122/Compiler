# Compiler

This repository follows along with Introduction to "Compilers and Language Design" by Prof. Douglas Thain from the University of Notre Dame

The end goal is to build up a complete compiler for a high-level programming language (C? idk haven't decided yet') through 5 phases:

* Scanner
* Parser
* Pretty-Printer
* Typechecker
* Code Generator
